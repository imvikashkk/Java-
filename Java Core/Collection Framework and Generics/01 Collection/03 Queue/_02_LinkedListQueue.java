/* LinkedList is a class which is implemented in the collection framework which inherently 
implements the linked list data structure. It is a linear data structure where the 
elements are not stored in contiguous locations and every element is a separate object 
with a data part and address part. The elements are linked using pointers and addresses. 
Each element is known as a node. Due to the dynamicity and ease of insertions and 
deletions, they are preferred over the arrays or queues. Letâ€™s see how to create a queue 
object using this class. */
