/* 
EnumSet class which is implemented in the collections framework is one of the specialized 
implementations of the Set interface for use with the enumeration type. It is a high-performance 
set implementation, much faster than HashSet. All of the elements in an enum set must come from 
a single enumeration type that is specified when the set is created either explicitly or 
implicitly. Letâ€™s see how to create a set object using this class.
