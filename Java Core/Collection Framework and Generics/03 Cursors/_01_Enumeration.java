/* 
We can use Enumeration to get objects one by one from legacy collection(Vector, Hashtable)
object. We can create Enumeration object by using elements() method of Vector class.

/*  
Here "v" is an Vector class object. e is of
type Enumeration interface and refers to "v
"

/*
  There are two methods in the Enumeration interface namely : 
1. public boolean hasMoreElements(): This method tests if this enumeration contains more elements or not.
2. public Object nextElement(): This method returns the next element of this enumeration. 
   It throws NoSuchElementException if no more element is present

/* 
There are certain limitations of enumeration which are as follows: 
    Enumeration is for legacy classes(Vector, Hashtable) only. Hence it is not a universal iterator.
    Remove operations canâ€™t be performed using Enumeration.
    Only forward direction iterating is possible.
