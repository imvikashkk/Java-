**************************************** COLLECTIONS ********************************************
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Any group of individual objects which are represented as a single unit is known as the collection 
of the objects. In Java, a separate framework named the “Collection Framework” has been defined in 
JDK 1.2 which holds all the collection classes and interface in it. 

The Collection interface (java.util.Collection) and Map interface (java.util.Map) are the two 
main “root” interfaces of Java collection classes.


What is a Framework?
-------------------------
A framework is a set of classes and interfaces which provide a ready-made architecture. In order 
to implement a new feature or a class, there is no need to define a framework. However, an optimal 
object-oriented design always includes a framework with a collection of classes such that all the 
classes perform the same kind of task. 





Advantages Of Collection Framework.
------------------------------------

Consistent API: 
       The API has a basic set of interfaces like Collection, Set, List, or Map, all the classes 
       (ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector, etc) that implement these interfaces have some common set 
       of methods.
     
Reduces programming effort: 
        A programmer doesn’t have to worry about the design of the Collection but rather he can 
        focus on its best use in his program. Therefore, the basic concept of Object-oriented 
        programming (i.e.) abstraction has been successfully implemented.
 
Increases program speed and quality: 
        Increases performance by providing high-performance implementations of useful data 
        structures and algorithms because in this case, the programmer need not think of the best 
        implementation of a specific data structure. He can simply use the best implementation to 
        drastically boost the performance of his algorithm/program.

















HASHING
--------------
00. Hashing is a technique to quickly find, add, and remove
    elements from a collection.
00. Example, directory of words
00. Hashing stores the data in such a way that retrieval of
    data is fast. It uses a function(hash function) to create an
    index(hash code) and this index is used to narrow down
    the search.
00. These indexes are maintained in a hash table.
00. The hash table is quickly an array of linked list.
