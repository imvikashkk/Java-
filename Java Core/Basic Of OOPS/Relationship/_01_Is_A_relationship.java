/****************************
 * Is-A relationship*********************
 * Is-A relationship: Whenever one class inherits another class,
 * it is called an IS-A relationship
 * 
 * IS-A Relationship is wholly related to Inheritance. For example â€“
 * a kiwi is a fruit; a bulb is a device.
 * 
 * IS-A relationship can simply be achieved by using extends Keyword.
 * 
 * IS-A relationship is additionally used for code reusability in Java and to
 * avoid code
 * redundancy.
 * 
 * IS-A relationship is unidirectional, which means we can say that a bulb is a
 * device,
 * but vice versa; a device is a bulb is not possible since all the devices are
 * not bulbs.
 * 
 * IS-A relationship is tightly coupled, which means changing one entity will
 * affect another
 * entity
 * 
 * Advantage of IS-A relationship :
 * 
 * Code Reusability.
 * Reduce redundancy.
