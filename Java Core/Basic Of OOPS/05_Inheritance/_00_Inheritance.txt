-> Inheritance is an important pillar of OOP(Object-Oriented Programming)
-> It is the mechanism in java by which one class is allowed to inherit the
   features(fields and methods) of another class.
-> In OOPS, Inheritance means creating new classes based on existing ones.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When we construct a new class from existing class in such a way that the new
class access all the features & properties of existing class called inheritance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Super Class/Parent Class: The class whose features are inherited is known as a 
                          superclass(or a base class or a parent class).

Sub Class/Child Class: The class that inherits the other class is known as a 
                       subclass(or a derived class, extended class, or child class).
                       The subclass can add its own fields and methods in addition to
                       the superclass fields and methods.



The extends keyword is used for inheritance in java. Using the extends keyword indicates you
are derived from an existing class. In other words, “extends” refers to increased functionality.


. It provide code reusability.
. We can not access private members of class through inheritance.
. A subclass contains all the features of super class so, we should
    create the object of sub class.
. Method Overriding only possible through inheritance.
