A JAR (Java Archive) is a package file format typically used to aggregate many Java class files 
and associated metadata and resources (text, images, etc.) into one file to distribute application 
software or libraries on the Java platform. 

In simple words, a JAR file is a file that contains a compressed version of .class files, audio 
files, image files, or directories. We can imagine a .jar file as a zipped file(.zip) that is 
created by using WinZip software. Even, WinZip software can be used to extract the contents of 
a .jar . So you can use them for tasks such as lossless data compression, archiving, decompression, 
and archive unpacking. 


1.1 Create a JAR file
------------------------
            to create jar file , we need to create some folder
            bin
            docs
            resources
            src\main_folder

     1 - Compile source files
     javac -cp src src\_main_folder\*.java -d bin

     2 - Generate javadoc
     javadoc src\_main_folder\*.java -d docs

     3 - Generate Jar file
     jar cvfm name_of_jar.jar resources\manifest.txt -C bin . src docs

     4 - Execute Jar file
     java -jar name_of_jar.jar
